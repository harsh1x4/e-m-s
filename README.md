### Employee-Management-System

This project is created using nextJS as frontend, and Spring-Boot as backend.

In the ```server``` folder, there is a file named ```pushJSONToAPI```, which can be used to populate data on the server.

I have added the backend submodule created using ```Spring Boot```. The database used in this backend is H2, which will be reset every time the project is rerun. So this is why the ```pushJSONtoAPI``` file is provided.

Depending on what you have installed on your computer, you can use the ```pushJSONtoAPI``` with ```node``` or ```nodemon.```Â 

To get started with the frontend, you should have nodeJS installed on your computer so that you can install the required dependencies.

Type ```npm install``` in the terminal.
Then execute ```npm run dev```.
